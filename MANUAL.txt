Nexus PHP Library for Systens Vr. 0
===================================

The Nexus PHP Library was created to facilitate the development of systems
developed in PHP. It creates a system environment in the window-based browser,
where you will have a virtual desktop, menu and taskbar.

Form creation is based on XML files and the Menu structure is stored in the
database.

Much of the data processing such as listing, inserts, updates, and deletes are
the responsibility of the library, by simply setting up the XML correctly
to do so.
